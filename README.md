### This code contains navigation with:

- AuthProvider (simulates authentication process)
- go_routers **redirect** listener
  - Navigates between Splash, OnBoarding, SignIn and BottomNavBar

Don't bother doing it from scratch, copy the code instead! <3

**The Navigation Stack:**

- Splash Page
- OnBoarding Page
- SignIn Page
- BottomNavBar
  - Home
    - ReadStory Page
  - Discover
  - Shop
- Account
